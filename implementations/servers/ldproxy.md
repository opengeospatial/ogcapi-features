  * OpenAPI definition: https://demo.ldproxy.net/daraa/api
  * Landing page: https://demo.ldproxy.net/daraa
* Vineyards in Rhineland-Palatinate dataset:
  * OpenAPI definition: https://demo.ldproxy.net/vineyards/api
  * Landing page: https://demo.ldproxy.net/vineyards

Most resources are available as HTML and JSON. Add `f=json` or `f=html` to override HTTP content negotiation.
