# OGC API - Features

This GitHub repository contains [OGC](http://opengeospatial.org)'s
standard for querying geospatial information on the web, "OGC API - Features".

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs
in a consistent way. [OpenAPI](http://openapis.org) is used to define the reusable
API building blocks with responses in JSON and HTML.

The OGC API family of standards is organized by resource type. OGC API Features
specifies the fundamental API building blocks for interacting with features.
The spatial data community uses the term 'feature' for things in the real world
that are of interest.

If you are unfamiliar with the term 'feature', the explanations on
[Spatial Things, Features and Geometry](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#spatial-things-features-and-geometry)
in the W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practice document provide more detail.

## Overview

OGC API Features provides access to collections of geospatial data.

```
GET /collections
```

Lists the collections of data on the server that can be queried ([7.12](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r1.html#_feature_collections)),
and each describes basic information about the geospatial data collection, like its id and description, as well as the
spatial and temporal extents of all the data contained

```
GET /collections/buildings/items?bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89
```

Requests all the data in the collection "buildings" that is in the New Zealand economic zone.
The response format (typically HTML or a [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) feature
collection, but GML is supported, too, and extensions can easily supply others) is determined using
[HTTP content negotiation](https://restfulapi.net/content-negotiation/).

Data is returned in pageable chunks, with each response containing a `next` link
as many collections are quite large. The core specification supports a few basic filters, in
addition to the `bbox` filter above, with extensions providing more advanced options
([7.14](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r1.html#_feature_collection_2)).

```
GET /collections/{collectionId}/items/{featureId}
```

Returns a single 'feature' - something in the real-world (a building,
a stream, a county, etc.) that typically is described by a geometry plus other properties.
This provides a stable, canonical URL to link to the 'thing'
([7.15](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r1.html#_feature_2)).

## Using the standard

A stable draft is available (from April 2018). Note that the draft uses the title "Web Feature Service" or "WFS",
version 3.0. This was the original title and newer [editor's drafts](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r1.html)
already use the new title "OGC API - Features".

A [PDF version](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=79027&version=1) is available, too.

Those who want to just see the endpoints and responses can explore the generic
OpenAPI definition on SwaggerHub:

Several implementations of the draft standard exist:

Most all work on the specification takes place in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues),
so browse there to get a good idea of what is happening, as well as past decisions.

## Additional Information

In addition to feedback from the initial implementations as well as discussions on GitHub and in the OGC/ISO working group,
the current draft standard has been tested in a [WFS 3.0 Hackathon](http://www.opengeospatial.org/blog/2764), the [OGC Testbed-14](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/testbed14), the [OGC Vector Tiles Pilot](https://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/vt-pilot-2018) and other activities.

Feedback for the Core is collected and discussed in the
[GitHub issues for Part 1 (Core)](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/projects/1).
The current expectation is to have a stable version of the Core specification by August 2019.
This version would then be the input for the next steps in the standardization process
in OGC and ISO/TC 211.

The latest draft for Part 1 (Core) is the [Editor's Draft](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r1.html), also available as
[PDF](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r1.pdf).

Also a non-normative document, the "Users Guide", and Part 2, support for Coordinate Reference Systems, are being developed.
