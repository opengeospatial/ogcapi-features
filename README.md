This GitHub repository is used by the OGC WFS/FES SWG and the ISO/TC 211/PT 19142+43 to develop the next major revision of the Web Feature Service and Filter Encoding standards.

WARNING: This repository contains early drafts.

A draft for part 1 of WFS 3.0 is available. It is basically a complete draft, except for editorial sections:

* [OGC Web Feature Service 3.0 - Part 1: Core, Editors' draft](https://cdn.rawgit.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/docs/17-069.html)
* [Implementations of the draft specification / demo services](implementations.md)

The draft will be reviewed during November 2017 and this revision cycle is intended to be completed in December 2017.

* [Open issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues)
* [Proposing changes](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/wiki/Propose-a-change-to-a-draft-of-a-WFS-specification-document)

By January 2018, the draft should be ready for wider review, implementation and feedback. A revised version based on more implementation feedback could be available late in 2018.

Depending on the progress and community interest, work on additional parts supporting transactions, more complex queries, etc. could start in early 2018.
