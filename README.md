## About

WARNING: This repository contains early drafts.

A draft for part 1 of WFS 3.0 is available. It is basically a complete draft, except for editorial sections:

* [OGC Web Feature Service 3.0 - Part 1: Core, Editors' draft](https://cdn.rawgit.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/docs/17-069.html)
* [Implementations of the draft specification / demo services](implementations.md)

The draft is currently under review.

* [Open issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues)
* [Proposing changes](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/wiki/Propose-a-change-to-a-draft-of-a-WFS-specification-document)

By February 2018, the draft should be ready for wider review, implementation and feedback. A revised version based on more implementation feedback could be available late in 2018.

Depending on the progress and community interest, work on additional parts supporting transactions, more complex queries, etc. could start in March 2018.
