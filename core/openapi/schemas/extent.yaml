  The extent of the features in the collection. In the Core only spatial and temporal
  extents are specified. Extensions may add additional members to represent other
  extents, for example, thermal or pressure ranges.

    description: |-
      The spatial extent of the features in the collection.
    type: object
    properties:
      bbox:
        description: |-
          One or more bounding boxes that describe the spatial extent of the dataset.
          In the Core only a single bounding box is supported. Extensions may support
          additional areas. If multiple areas are provided, the union of the bounding
          boxes describes the spatial extent.

        items:
          description: |-
            West, south, east, north edges of the bounding box. The coordinates
            are in the coordinate reference system specified in `crs`. By default
            this is WGS 84 longitude/latitude.

          example:

            - -90
            - 180
            - 90
      crs:
        description: |-
          Coordinate reference system of the coordinates in the spatial extent
          (property `bbox`). The default reference system is WGS 84 longitude/latitude.
          In the Core this is the only supported coordinate reference system.
          Extensions may support additional coordinate reference systems and add
          additional enum values.
        type: string
        enum:
          - 'http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84'
        default: 'http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84'
  temporal:
    description: |-
      The temporal extent of the features in the collection.
    type: object
    properties:
      interval:
        description: |-
          One or more time intervals that describe the temporal extent of the dataset.
          The value `null` is supported and indicates an open time intervall.
          In the Core only a single time interval is supported. Extensions may support
          multiple intervals. If multiple intervals are provided, the union of the
          intervals describes the temporal extent.
        type: array
        minItems: 1
        items:
          description: |-
            Begin and end times of the time interval. The timestamps
            are in the coordinate reference system specified in `trs`. By default
            this is the Gregorian calendar.
          type: array
          minItems: 2
          maxItems: 2
          items:
            type: string
            format: date-time
            nullable: true
          example:
            - '2011-11-11T12:22:11Z'
            - null
      trs:
        description: |-
          Coordinate reference system of the coordinates in the temporal extent
          (property `interval`). The default reference system is the Gregorian calendar.
          In the Core this is the only supported temporal reference system.
          Extensions may support additional temporal reference systems and add
          additional enum values.
