For each feature collection in this distribution of the dataset,
the `links` property of the collection SHOULD include an item for
each supported encoding with a link to the collection resource
(relation: `license`).

Alternatively, if all data shared via the API is available under
the same license, the link MAY instead be added to the top-level
`links` property of the response.

Multiple links to the license in different content types MAY be
provided. At least a link to content type `text/html` or
`text/plain` SHOULD be provided.
