If features in the feature collection include a feature property that has a
simple value (for example, a string or integer) that is expected to be useful
for applications using the service to filter the features of the collection
based on this property, you SHOULD support a parameter with the name of the
feature property and with the following characteristics (using an
OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
in: query
required: false
style: form
explode: false
----

The `schema` property SHOULD be the same as the definition of the feature
property in the response schema.
