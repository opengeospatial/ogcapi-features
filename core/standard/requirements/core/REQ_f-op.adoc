For every feature in a feature collection (path `/collections/{collectionId}/items`),
the service SHALL support the HTTP GET operation at the path
`/collections/{collectionId}/items/{featureId}`.

The parameter `collectionId` is each `id` property in the feature
collections metadata (JSONPath: `$.collections[*].id`). `featureId` is a
local identifier of the feature.
