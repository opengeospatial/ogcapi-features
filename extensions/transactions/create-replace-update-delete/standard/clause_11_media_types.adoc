- CREATE and REPLACE operations will use `application/geo+json`,
- UPDATE operations will use `application/merge-patch+json`,
- schema documents will use `application/schema+json`.

For GML features,

- CREATE and REPLACE operations will use `application/gml+xml`,
- UPDATE operations will use `application/xml`,
- schema documents will use `application/xml`.
