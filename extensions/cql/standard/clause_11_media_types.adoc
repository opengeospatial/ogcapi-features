== Media Types

See <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core>>, Clause 10.

NOTE: No media type has been registered for the CQL encodings. The reason is the assumption that filter expressions as such will rarely be used as
requests or responses, but usually be part of a request or response and be embedded in it.
