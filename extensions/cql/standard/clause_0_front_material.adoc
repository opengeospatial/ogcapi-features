[big]*i.     Abstract*

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web API
in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the
API building blocks.

OGC API Features provides API building blocks to create, modify and query
features on the Web. OGC API Features is comprised of multiple parts, each
of them is a separate standard.

A fundamental operation performed on a collection of resources is that of
filtering in order to obtain a subset of the data which contains resource
instances that satisfy some filtering criteria.  This part, part 3, defines

* query parameters (`filter`, `filter-lang`, `filter-crs`) to specify filter
criteria in a request to an API;
* a filter grammar called Common Query Language (CQL) for specifying enhanced
filtering criteria beyond what is supported in the Core;
* two encodings for CQL - a text and a JSON encoding.

The Common Query Language (CQL) defined in this document can be used to specify
how resource instances in a source collection can be filtered to identify a
result set. Typically, CQL is used in query operations to identify the
subset of resources that should be included in a response document.
However, CQL can also be used in other operations (e.g. updates) to
identify the subset of resources that should be affected by an operation.

Each resource instance in the source collection is evaluated against a filtering
expression. The filter expression always evaluates to `true` or `false`. If the
expression evaluates to true, the resource instance satisfies the expression and
is marked as being in the result set. If the overall filter expression evaluates
to false, the data instance is not in the result set.  Thus, the net effect of
evaluating a filter expression is a set of resources that satisfy the predicates
in the expression.

This draft is not complete and there are open issues that are still under discussion.
