== Requirements Class "Basic CQL"

[[basic-cql-overview]]
=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_basic-cql.adoc[]

This clause defines the core of a query language called `Common Query Language`
(CQL) that may be used to construct filter expressions. This core is called Basic CQL.

Subsequent clauses define additional filtering capabilities as well as several
encodings of CQL.

[[basic-cql_filter-expression]]
=== CQL filter expression

A CQL filter expression is an expression that defines a logically connected
set of predicates that are evaluated for each item of a collection.

A predicate is an expression that evaluates to the Boolean values of `TRUE`
or `FALSE` or that evaluates to the value `NULL` when dealing with unknown
values.

If a predicate evaluates to `TRUE` for an item, the item qualifies for
further processing such as presentation in the result set, being passed on
to the next predicate in the filter for further evaluation, and so forth.

If the predicate evaluates to `FALSE` or `NULL` for an item, the item is not
available for further processing.

A collection item that satisfies ALL the requirements of a CQL filter expression
evaluates to a Boolean value of `TRUE`; otherwise the CQL filter expression
evaluates to `FALSE`.

include::requirements/basic-cql/REQ_cqlfilter.adoc[]

Literal values do not have to be supported on the left hand side of predicates and 
property references do not have to be supported on the right hand side of
predicates.

include::recommendations/basic-cql/PER_cqlfilter.adoc[]

A Basic CQL filter expression can be constructed by logically connecting one
or more comparison predicates.

Support for the parts of CQL that are not part of Basic CQL is added in additional
requirements classes in <<cql-enhancements>>:

* The rules `isLikePredicate`, `isBetweenPredicate` and `isInListPredicate` are added by requirements class <<rc_advanced-comparison-operators,Advanced Comparison Operators>>;
* The rule `spatialPredicate` is added by requirements class <<rc_spatial-operators,Spatial Operators>>;
* The rule `temporalPredicate` is added by requirements class <<rc_temporal-operators,Temporal Operators>>.
* The rule `arrayPredicate` is added by requirements class <<rc_array-operators,Array Operators>>;
* The permission to not support the literal rules on the left hand side of predicates and the rule `propertyName` on the right hand side are removed by requirements class <<rc_property-property,Property-Property Comparisons>>;
* The rule `function` is added by requirements class <<rc_functions,Custom Functions>>;
* The rule `arithmeticExpression` is added by requirements class <<rc_arithmetic,Arithmetic Expressions>>.

Examples of Basic CQL filter expressions are included in the subsequent sub-clauses.

[[basic-cql_literals]]
=== Literal values

A literal value is any part of an CQL filter expression that is used
exactly as it is specified in the expression. Literal values include:

* character strings (rule `characterLiteral`),
* numbers including integers and floating point values (rule `numericLiteral`),
* booleans (rule `booleanLiteral`),
* spatial geometries like points, line strings or polygons (rule `spatialLiteral`) and
* temporal geometries like instants or intervals (rule `temporalLiteral`).

For spatial and temporal geometries existing representations are used:

* Spatial geometry:
** Text: an https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=25355[OGC Well-Known Text (WKT)] literal
** JSON: a https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.1[GeoJSON geometry] object
* Temporal instant:
** Text: a `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` function with a https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6[RFC 3339 literal string]
** JSON: an object with a `date` or `timestamp` member with a https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6[RFC 3339 literal string value]
* Temporal interval:
** Text: an `INTERVAL` function with two temporal instants as parameters
** JSON: an object with an `interval` member with an array of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6[RFC 3339 literal string] values (or ".." for an open end)

All temporal literals are in UTC ("Z").

[[basic-cql_property]]
=== Property references

Properties in an object being evaluated in the CQL filter expression can be
referenced by their name (rule `propertyName`).

include::requirements/basic-cql/REQ_property.adoc[]

For example, a property name used in a scalar expression (rule `scalarExpression`)
has to be a queryable of type `string`, `number`, `integer` or `boolean`.
