[[spatial-operators]]
=== Requirements Class "Spatial Operators"

include::requirements/requirements_class_spatial-operators.adoc[]

This requirement adds a set of Dimensionally Extended Nine-intersection Model (DE-9IM) relation operators that may be used to add spatial predicates to a CQL filter expression.

A _spatial predicate_ evaluates two geometry-valued expressions to determine if the expressions satisfy the requirements of the specified spatial operator.

include::requirements/spatial-operators/REQ_spatial-predicate.adoc[]

include::requirements/spatial-operators/REQ_spatial-operators.adoc[]

include::recommendations/spatial-operators/PER_spatial-predicates.adoc[]

CQL uses Well-Known Text (WKT) to encode geometry literals. Since WKT does not provide a capability to specify the CRS of a geometry literal, the server has to determine the CRS of the geometry literals in a filter expression through another mechanism. In this standard, the `filter-crs` query parameter is used to pass the CRS information to the server.

NOTE: The spatial predicates currently use a different pattern than the comparison and temporal predicates and are written as function calls.  This difference is inherited from previous versions of CQL. This is an open issue: Whether this version of CQL used in the OGC API - Features - Part 3 standard should change the spatial predicates to be consistent with the other predicates or to keep the legacy because of existing CQL implementations.  Comments are welcome in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/issues/493[GitHub issue] on this topic.

The following table lists the mathematical definitions of each spatial operator as described in <<ogc06-103r4,OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard for Geographic information - Simple feature access - Part 1: Common architecture>>.

[[temporal-operators]]
=== Requirements Class "Temporal Operators"

include::requirements/requirements_class_temporal-operators.adoc[]

A temporal predicate evaluates two time-valued expressions to determine, if the expressions satisfy the requirements of the specified temporal operator.

The operands in a temporal predicate are temporal geometries. A temporal geometry is either an instant or an interval.

An instant is either a date or a timestamp in accordance with <<rfc3339,RFC 3339>> (rules `full-date` or `date-time`). Note that since time is continuous, every instant has a duration and a start/end. Nevertheless, the geometry can be considered an instant in the temporal resolution that is applicable for the specific property.

An interval is the time between a start instant and an end instant, including both bounding instances.

CQL follows ISO 8601-1/ISO 8601-2 in defining intervals as closed at both start and end. Note that some implementations and other specifications use a different definition and it may be necessary to convert between the interval representations. For example, SQL uses half-closed intervals - closed at the start, open at the end.

Depending on the implementation environment, the underlying datastore may or may not support intervals as data types of properties. If not, intervals are typically represented by two separate properties that are instants, one for the start and one for the end of the interval.

All temporal geometries are in the Gregorian Calendar. This is a deliberate restriction to keep implementations of CQL simple, avoiding requirements to transform time instants to other temporal coordinate reference systems, but still cover a large number of use cases. This is consistent with the use of RFC 3339 as a key standard for expressing date and time on the internet, including in the OGC API standards.

The temporal operators in CQL are based on the definitions in the <<owl-time,W3C/OGC Time Ontology in OWL>>. 

The following table specifies the definition of the temporal operators where both operands may be instants or intervals, including mixed combinations.

|T_EQUALS |Start and end of t1 and t2 are coincident
|T_INTERSECTS |NOT (t1 T_DISJOINT t2)

Additional temporal operators are available, but only applicable for intervals. Using these operators with instants will result in a client error.
