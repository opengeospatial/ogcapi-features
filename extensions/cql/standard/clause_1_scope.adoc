== Scope

This document specifies an extension to the <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features -
Part 1: Core>> standard that defines the behavior of a server that supports
enhanced filtering capabilities expressed using the Common Query Language (CQL2).

Enhanced filtering capabilities in this case means that the server supports
the ability to define selection clauses using predicates beyond those supported
by Part 1 (i.e., `bbox` and `datetime`).

This document defines

* Query parameters for specifying a filter in a request to a Web API;
* A text encoding for a CQL2 filter suitable for use as a query parameter in a URL;
* A JSON encoding for a CQL2 filter suitable for use in a HTTP POST body;
* How the set of properties that can be used to construct CQL2 expressions ("queryables") are published by a Web API.
