[[cql2-encodings]]
== Requirements classes for encodings

=== Overview

This clause specifies requirements for a text encoding and a JSON encoding of CQL2.

[[cql2-text]]
=== Requirements Class "CQL2 Text"

include::requirements/requirements_class_cql2-text.adoc[]

This requirements class defines a Well Known Text (WKT) encoding of CQL2. Such an
encoding would be suitable for use with the GET query parameter such as the
<<rc_filter,`filter`>> parameter.

The "CQL2 Text" encoding is defined by the BNF grammar defined in <<cql2-bnf>>.

Keywords in the BNF grammar are case-insensitive. <<BNF,Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications>> states:

> ABNF strings are case insensitive and the character set for these strings is US-ASCII.

The list of CQL2 keywords includes:

* "A_EQUALS"
* "A_CONTAINS"
* "A_CONTAINEDBY"
* "A_OVERLAPS"
* "AND"
* "BETWEEN"
* "ENVELOPE"
* "FALSE"
* "GEOMETRYCOLLECTION"
* "IN"
* "LIKE"
* "LINESTRING"
* "MULTILINESTRING"
* "MULTIPOINT"
* "MULTIPOLYGON"
* "NOT"
* "NULL"
* "OR"
* "POINT"
* "POLYGON"
* "S_INTERSECTS"
* "S_EQUALS"
* "S_DISJOINT"
* "S_TOUCHES"
* "S_WITHIN"
* "S_OVERLAPS"
* "S_CROSSES"
* "S_CONTAINS"
* "T_AFTER"
* "T_BEFORE"
* "T_CONTAINS"
* "T_DISJOINT"
* "T_DURING"
* "T_EQUALS"
* "T_FINISHEDBY"
* "T_FINISHES"
* "T_INTERSECTS"
* "T_MEETS"
* "T_METBY"
* "T_OVERLAPPEDBY"
* "T_OVERLAPS"
* "T_STARTEDBY"
* "T_STARTS"
* "TRUE"

[[cql2-json]]
=== Requirements Class "CQL2 JSON"

include::requirements/requirements_class_cql2-json.adoc[]

This requirements class defines a JSON encoding of CQL2. Such an encoding
would be suitable as the body of an HTTP POST request.

NOTE: Attention is drawn to the fact that there exists an alternative JSON encoding for CQL2 based on the use of arrays that can be found here: https://github.com/tschaub/ogcapi-features/tree/json-array-expression/extensions/cql2/jfe. The OGC API - Features Standards Working Group will review both encodings and decide which one to adopt. Feedback from implementers is welcome.

[[cql2-xml]]
=== XML encoding

This OGC API - Features - Part 3 standard does not specifically define an
XML-encoding for CQL2. However, it is recognized that XML is still in common
use and so implementers are directed to review the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/09-026r2/09-026r2.html[OGC Filter Encoding 2.0] standard which defines a XML-encoding for filter expressions that closely matches most of the functionality of CQL2.
