^|A |The _like predicate_ (rule `isLikePredicate`) tests whether a string value matches the specified pattern. If the value matches the pattern (rule `patternExpression`), then the predicate SHALL evaluate to the Boolean value `TRUE`. Otherwise the predicate SHALL evaluate to the Boolean value `FALSE`.
^|B |The scalar expression (rule `scalarExpression`) in rule `isLikePredicate` SHALL evaluate to a `characterLiteral`.
^|C |The wildcard character SHALL be the percent character (ASCII x25, `%`).
^|D |The wildcard SHALL match zero of more characters in the test value.
^|E |The wildcard character SHALL not match the NULL value.
