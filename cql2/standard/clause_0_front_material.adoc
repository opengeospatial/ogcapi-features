[big]*i.     Abstract*

A fundamental operation performed on a <<collection-def,collection>> of features is that of
filtering in order to obtain a subset of the data which contains feature
instances that satisfy some filtering criteria. This document specifies

* A filter grammar called Common Query Language (CQL2);
* Two encodings for CQL2 - a text and a JSON encoding.

The Common Query Language (CQL2) defined in this document is a generic filter
grammar that can be used to specify how <<resource-def,resource>> instances in a source
collection of any item type, including features, can be filtered to identify
a results set. Typically, CQL2 is used in query operations to identify the
subset of resources, such as features, that should be included in a response
document. However, CQL2 can also be used in other operations, such as updates,
to identify the subset of resources that should be affected by an operation.

Each resource instance in the source collection is evaluated against a filtering
expression. The filter expression always evaluates to `true`, `false` or `null`. If the
expression evaluates to `true`, the resource instance satisfies the expression and
is marked as being in the result set. If the overall filter expression evaluates
to `false` or `null`, the data instance is not in the result set.  Thus, the net effect of
evaluating a filter expression is a set of resources that satisfy the predicates
in the expression.

The Common Query Language and its text encoding are not new, but this is the first time 
that the language is properly specified. The Common Query Language with the acronym CQL 
was originally created as a text encoding based on the capabilities defined in the 
https://www.ogc.org/standards/filter[OGC Filter Encoding] standard for use in the 
https://www.ogc.org/standards/cat[OGC Catalogue Service] standard. 

The Common Query Language as specified in this document is a revision of this earlier
version. While the language design including the classification of operators are 
consistent with the earlier specification, there have been a number of changes and 
existing implementations of CQL will need to be updated to process filter expressions
specified by this document. This document therefore uses the acronym CQL2 to refer to
the current version of the Common Query Language.

NOTE: The use of CQL2 also distinguishes the Common Query Language from other existing uses
of CQL for query languages, for example, for the Cassandra Query Language.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version.
