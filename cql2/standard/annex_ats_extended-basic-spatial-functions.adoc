The term "geometry data type" is used for the following data types: Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString, Polygon, MultiPolygon, or GeometryCollection.

|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | <<req_{conf-class}_spatial-predicate,/req/{conf-class}/spatial-predicate>>, <<req_{conf-class}_spatial-functions,/req/{conf-class}/spatial-functions>>, <<req_{conf-class}_spatial-functions,/req/{conf-class}/spatial-data-types>>
|Test purpose: | Test the S_INTERSECTS spatial comparison function with points, multi-points, line strings, multi-line string, polyons, mult-polygons, geometry collections and bounding boxes.
|Test method: | 
Given:

* One of more data sources each with a list of queryables.
* At least one queryable has a geometry data type.

When:

For each queryable `{queryable}` with a geometry data type, evaluate the following filter expressions

* `S_INTERSECTS({queryable},BBOX(-180,-90,180,90))`
* `S_INTERSECTS({queryable},POINT(7.02 49.92))`
* `S_INTERSECTS({queryable},POINT(90 180))`
* `S_INTERSECTS({queryable},BBOX(-180,-90,-90,90)) AND S_INTERSECTS({queryable},BBOX(90,-90,180,90))`

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation for the first two filter expressions;
* assert unsuccessful execution of the evaluation for the third filter expressions (invalid coordinate);
* store the valid predicates for each data source.

|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | all requirements
|Test purpose: | Test predicates against the test dataset
|Test method: | 
Given:

* The implementation under test uses the test dataset.

When:

Evaluate each predicate in <<test-data-predicates-s_intersects-operator>>.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;
* assert that the expected result is returned;
* store the valid predicates for each data source.

:conf-test: logical
==== Conformance Test {counter:test-id}
[cols=">20h,<80a",width="100%"]
|===
|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | n/a
|Test purpose: | Test filter expressions with AND, OR and NOT including sub-expressions
|Test method: | 
Given:

* The stored predicates for each data source, including from the dependencies.

When:

For each data source, select at least 10 random combinations of four predicates (`{p1}` to `{p4}`) from the stored predicates and evaluate the filter expression `\((NOT {p1} AND {p2}) OR ({p3} and NOT {p4}) or not ({p1} AND {p4}))`.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation.
