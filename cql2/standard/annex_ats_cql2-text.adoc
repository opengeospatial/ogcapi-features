|===
|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | <<req_{conf-class}_escaping,/req/{conf-class}/escaping>>
|Test purpose: | Test escaping in string literals.
|Test method: | 
Given:

* One of more data sources containing string literals with embedded single quotation (`'`) and/or BELL, and/or BACKSPACE, and/or HORIZONTAL TAB, and/or NEWLINE, and/or VERTICAL TAB, and/or FORM FEED, and/or CARRIAGE RETURN characters.
