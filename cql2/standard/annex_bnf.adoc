== CQL2 BNF (Normative)

[NOTE]
====
Because there are many variations of EBNF, this standard has focused on verifying that this grammar validates using the following online validator:

If other tools are used (e.g. ANTLR), the grammar will likely need to be adapted to suite the target implementation context.
