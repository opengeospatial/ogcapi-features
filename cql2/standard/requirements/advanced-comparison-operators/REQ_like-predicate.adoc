^|B |If the value does not match the pattern (`patternExpression`), then the predicate SHALL evaluate ot the Boolean value `FALSE`.
^|C |If the character expression (rule `characterExpression`) and/or the pattern expression (rule `patternExpression`) in the predicate is `NULL`, then the predicate SHALL evaluate to the value `NULL`. 
^|D |The character expression (rule `characterExpression`) in rule `isLikePredicate` SHALL evaluate to a `characterLiteral`.
^|E |The wildcard character SHALL be the percent character (ASCII x25, `%`).
^|F |The wildcard SHALL match zero of more characters in the test value.
^|G |The wildcard character SHALL not match the NULL value.
